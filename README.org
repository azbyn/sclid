Sclid - a signal interface for your terminal*

this was inspired by [[https://github.com/isamert/scli][scli]] and uses a (highly) modified version of [[https://github.com/AsamK/signal-cli][signal-cli]]

 *if your terminal is [[https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty/][kitty]] - not guaranteed to work on other terminals.

* Installation
** Dependencies
   - =JRE 10= or above - it's bad enough working with java, at least let me have a modern(ish) version,
   - =dmd= or another d compiler, if you want to use another modify =DC= in the Makefile
   - =w3imgdisplay= - for showing images - in the future other protocols might be available,
   - =pnglatex= - for muh \LaTeX - not optional,
   - =ranger= - for selecting attachments,
   - =sqlite3= - for storing the message history - even if you don't store message to 
     disk (which you probably shouldn't) you need this,
   - =xclip= - for copying messages to clipboard,
   - =feh= and =qrencode= - only needed for the setup,
   - by the default you need a powerline patched font. you could edit =config.d= to replace those characters,
   - by default it uses [[https://github.com/chriskempson/base16][base16]] - you could replace =niceGray256= in =config.d= otherwise this is an ugly blue,
   - some sort of editor - you probably have at least =nano= or something.

*** Btw i use arch
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sudo pacman -S jre11-openjdk dmd w3m ranger sqlite3 xclip feh qrencode
#+END_SRC

=pnglatex= is only available in the aur. So replace =yay= with your aur helper of choice.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
yay -S pnglatex
#+END_SRC

** Downloading
The easy part:

clone this to a directory of your choice

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/azbyn/sclid
#+END_SRC

** Building
  Before doing anything you should go to =dlang/config.d= and edit things there. 
  This is customized to work on my machine and might not work on yours. 
  (or there might be things i want, but you don't (like the storing of messages part)

  While this is a valid =dub= project, you shouldn't run =dub= for building, that's only for testing the ui
  without waiting for signal (the java bit) to load up.

  You could build it in release mode, but you shouldn't do that yet. There +might be+ are bugs, and you wouldn't
  know what went wrong.

*** The actual instructions
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make -j2
sudo make install
#+END_SRC

** First setup (this is avoided if you configured signal-cli before)
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sclid YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER
#+END_SRC

Where you should replace =YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER= with your full phone number (natÃ¼rlich)
(something like =+1234567890=)

When the qr code shows up (you should respond with =y= before that), on your phone's Signal app go to 
=Settings > Linked Devices= scan the code.

You should now be see some windows.

You should type =:sync= to sync your contacts. 

** Using it afterwards

if you only have one user setup, you can do:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sclid
#+END_SRC

otherwise just:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
sclid YOUR_PHONE_NUMBER
#+END_SRC

* Quick terminology
  - =Minubuffer= that bit at the bottom with the =:= that you open with =:= or =M-x=
  - =ContactsWindow= the one on the left
  - =MessagesWindow= the one that has the messages
  - =InputWindow= where you write the message - below messages

* Keybindings
  There are vim-like and emacs-like keybindings. You'll figure it out.
  (look in =dlang/graphics/windowBase.d replaceSimilar= and in =dlang/graphics/inputWindow.d loop= for a full list)
  
  Something that might be useful is that in =InputWindow= =Alt+enter= adds a new line but doesn't send the message.

  In the =MinibufferWindow= (that bit at the bottom with the =:=) you can use these commands:

  - =quit= for quitting,
  - =sync= for syncing (you already know that one),
  - =reply= replies to the message you highlighted with your cursor in =MessagesWindow=
  - =unreply= to quit out of the replying
  - =attach= for attaching files
  - =edit= to edit the message in your favorite editor
  - =react= react to message you highlighted. If used alone it removes the reaction. Otherwise you should append
    =laugh=, =up=, =down=, =wow=, =angry=, =heart= or =sad=, which do what they sound like they do.
  - =copy= for copying the current message to the clipboard

  (look in =dlang/graphics/minibuffer.d= for a full list)
